# A Simple NFT Game: Defeat Death & Taxes

The goal of the game: to defeat the main boss. Who's the main boss? ðŸ’€ & ðŸ§® (Death & Taxes).

Choose your character, mint it, then attack the ultimate boss. There can be many characters attacking the boss, but there's only one boss. He's very strong though. It will take many heroes and many sacrificies to defeat him.

Each character (and the boss) has a given attack value.

Each character (and the boss) has a range of defense value. During each attack, the overall attack damage is calculated like this: Attack Damage - random number between defense_min and defense_max.

Once you die, you die, forever. But you help the next hero out. Some lucky hero in the future will have a chance to defeat Death & Taxes, for all of us.
